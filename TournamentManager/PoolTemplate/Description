This file explains the set up of the pool templates
Maximum of six teams pools for now

There will be files that describe the different situations of each type of pool.
The system will assume one team plays every other team in the pool.

Format of no work team:
Net#,Team1,Team2,-1

Format with a work team:
Net#,Team1,Team2,Work

Format with a work team and off teams:
Net#,Team1,Team2,Work,Off1...

Format with off teams but no work team:
Net#,Team1,Team2,-1,Off1...

If there are multiple nets and teams are playing at the same time. Once multiple nets are disclosed, the
setup is the same in the files it just have the net number that the game is being played on.
